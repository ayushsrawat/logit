## LOGIT

## TODOS
- [X] add tags to the http output event 
- [X] or say a identifier through which it know in which index I have to save this document
- [X] there gonna be multiple indexes, and I wanna store them at a place
- [X] like all the jcht logs gonna go into save dir, but on the basis of data?
- [X] is that something we can configure, that means the fluent bit just give me the name of the index, I will mange the data myself in the java code :)
- [ ] add multiple sources of logs with different regex and then handle them in logit
- [ ] the above will quite increase the resiliency and the shape of the project, because from the birth it know how to handle diverse data
